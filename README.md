# MMTech-ProjetoDev



---


## Daily Goals

#### Day 1:
- Decide which project I'll develop (it will likely be project 2)
- Decide which tools I'll use (likely NodeJS+React). 
- Think about the project. Conceptually, what should it look like?

#### Day 2:
- Create a template for both Backend and Frontend using the chosen tools. Ideally with some information flow already implemented (info comes from template dict on backend, is shown on frontend, user makes changes, dict is updated, etc)
- Familizarize myself with the tools I'll use (study possible libraries I can use to integrate a map into the frontend application for better visualization).


#### Day 3:
- Implement Database (probably PostgreSQL) into the data flow (instead of getting info just from a dict/json/csv file)
- Continue research on libraries, ideally implement a simple map view to show the travel points.


#### Day 4:

- Stop and Analyze how the project has been going. Create plan for next 4 days.
